Write a Unity Editor script.
- It provides its functionality as a menu item placed "AI" > "Do Task".
- It doesn’t provide any editor window. It immediately does the task when the menu item is invoked
- Don’t use GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag.
- There is no selected object. Find game objects manually.
- I only need the script body. Don’t add any explanation.
- The task is described as follows:
- Create 100 cubes at random points.
